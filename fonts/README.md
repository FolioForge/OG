# Font Assets

Renderer templates use the font stack `Inter, Arial, sans-serif`.

If you want guaranteed Inter rendering in hosted environments, install Inter on the host image or container runtime. This repository does not currently embed binary font assets by default.

Suggested files if you choose to bundle:
- `Inter-Regular.ttf`
- `Inter-Bold.ttf`
